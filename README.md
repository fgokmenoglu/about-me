# about-me
This is my very first repo that you may get to know me better if interested.

I am dedicated, hardworking and proactive electrical and electronics engineer with a strong technical background who possesses self-discipline and ability to work with minimum of supervision. I have solid work experience in design and test along with analyzing results to increase the overall efficiency of operations.

Then one day, I have started studying machine learning on a whim; but day by day I found myself spending more time since I really got into it. I have begun a graduate program as well. My focus is on machine learning for estimation and control under uncertainty. I want to apply what I learn to computer vision related studies because of my keen interest in this specific field. Furthermore, synthetic data generation is another topic that I occasionally spend time.

I also want to mention that I try to share my findings, studies and like on a regular basis through my Medium account or Substack newsletter. If interested, you can find the links below.

Finally, I am open to new connections to further my career.
